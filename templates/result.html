        You discover that the failure was caused by your colleage, David's neglegtion of maintenance duty. 
        He deliberately neglected his maintenance duties yesterday, 
        directly causing the failure. 
        Worse, it’s not his first offense. Over the course of the mission, David 
        has shown a careless disregard for protocols, putting lives at risk time and time again. 
        He has been warned before, but this time, David’s negligence has brought the situation 
        to the brink of catastrophe. 
        You can fix the issue, but it is going to be a long and demanding shift.
